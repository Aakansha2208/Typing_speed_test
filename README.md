Description:
The Typing Speed Test project is a Python application designed to measure a user's typing speed and accuracy. It presents the user with random sentences to type and calculates the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy of their typing.

Key Features:
1. Random Sentence Generation: The application generates random sentences of varying lengths and complexities for the user to type.
2. Timer: A timer starts as soon as the user begins typing and stops when the user completes typing the sentence.
3. Word per Minute (WPM) Calculation: The application calculates the user's typing speed in words per minute based on the time taken to type the sentence and the number of words typed.
4. Accuracy Calculation: The application calculates the accuracy of the user's typing by comparing the typed words with the original sentence.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with, displaying instructions and feedback on their performance.
6. Results Display: After completing the typing test, the application displays the user's WPM and accuracy, allowing them to track their progress over time.

Technologies Used:
- Python programming language
- Libraries such as tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), random for generating random sentences, and time for handling timing functions.

Potential Extensions:
1. Difficulty Levels: Implementing different difficulty levels for users to choose from, with varying sentence lengths and complexities.
2. Leaderboard: Adding a feature to store and display the highest scores of users, encouraging competition and motivation for improvement.
3. Typing Exercises: Expanding the project to include typing exercises or lessons to help users improve their typing skills systematically.
4. Multiplayer Mode: Introducing a multiplayer mode where users can compete against each other in real-time typing challenges.

Overall, the Typing Speed Test project provides a fun and practical way for users to assess and enhance their typing skills using Python.
